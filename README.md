# Eye Diseases Classification

## Overview
This project is a deep learning-based classification model for detecting and categorizing eye diseases. It classifies images into four categories:
- **Normal**
- **Cataract**
- **Diabetic Retinopathy**
- **Glaucoma**

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Augmentation, normalization, and resizing for better model performance.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses TensorFlow/Keras for training and evaluation.
- **Dataset Handling**: Supports custom datasets for training and testing.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the script:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python pandas seaborn
```

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Eye-Diseases-Classification.git
cd Eye-Diseases-Classification
```
2. Run the Python script:
```bash
python Eye_Diseases_Classification.py
```

## Expected Output
- Model training accuracy and loss graphs.
- Predictions on test images with classification labels.
